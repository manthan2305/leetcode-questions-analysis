To find the score of a node, consider if the node and the edges connected to it were removed. The tree would become one or more non-empty subtrees. The size of a subtree is the number of the nodes in it. The score of the node is the product of the sizes of all those subtrees. Return the number of nodes that have the highest score.

Maybe DFS? How to determine the number of nodes in the rest of the tree? Can you subtract the size of the subtree rooted at the node from the total number of nodes of the tree? Use these values to compute the score of the node. Track the maximum score, and how many nodes achieve such score.","863,1207,1465","Sum of Distances in Tree,Delete Nodes And Return Forest,Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree"
Parallel Courses III,parallel-courses-iii,2176,"You are given an integer n, which indicates that there are n courses labeled from 1 to n. You are also given a 2D integer array relations where relations[j] = [prevCoursej, nextCoursej] denotes that course prevCoursej has to be completed before course nextCoursej (prerequisite relationship). Furthermore, you are given a 0-indexed integer array time where time[i] denotes how many months it takes to complete the (i+1)th course. You must find the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses following these rules: Return the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses. Note: The test cases are generated such that it is possible to complete every course (i.e., the graph is a directed acyclic graph).
