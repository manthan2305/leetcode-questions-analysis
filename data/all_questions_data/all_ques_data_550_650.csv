Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer. A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes: We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps: If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki. Quad-Tree format: The input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below. It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].

Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number. You are given an integer array nums representing the data status of this set after the error. Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.

Replace Words,replace-words,648,"In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word successor.

Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the successors in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length. Return the sentence after the replacement.
