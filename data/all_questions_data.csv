We already know the rooms we have allocated till now and we also know when are they due to get free because of the end times of the meetings going on in those rooms. We can simply check the room which is due to get vacated the earliest amongst all the allocated rooms. Following up on the previous hint, we can make use of a min-heap to store the end times of the meetings in various rooms. So, every time we want to check if any room is free or not, simply check the topmost element of the min heap as that would be the room that would get free the earliest out of all the other rooms currently occupied.

 We keep the bracket and add it to the expression that we are building on the fly during recursion.
 OR, we can discard the bracket and move on. The one thing all these valid expressions have in common is that they will all be of the same length i.e. as compared to the original expression, all of these expressions will have the same number of characters removed. 

Can we somehow find the number of misplaced parentheses and use it in our solution? For every left parenthesis, we should have a corresponding right parenthesis. We can make use of two counters which keep track of misplaced left and right parenthesis and in one iteration we can find out these two values.

For a given integer, obtain its binary representation in the string form and work with the rules given in the problem. An integer can either represent the start of a UTF-8 character, or a part of an existing UTF-8 character. There are two separate rules for these two scenarios in the problem. If an integer is a part of an existing UTF-8 character, simply check the 2 most significant bits of in the binary representation string. They should be 10. If the integer represents the start of a UTF-8 character, then the first few bits would be 1 followed by a 0. The number of initial bits (most significant) bits determines the length of the UTF-8 character. 


Note: The array can contain multiple valid UTF-8 characters. String manipulation will work fine here. But, it is too slow. Can we instead use bit manipulation to do the validations instead of string manipulations? We can use bit masking to check how many initial bits are set for a given number. We only need to work with the 8 least significant bits as mentioned in the problem.

mask = 1 << 7
while mask & num:
    n_bytes += 1
    mask = mask >> 1


Can you use bit-masking to perform the second validation as well i.e. checking if the most significant bit is 1 and the second most significant bit a 0? To check if the most significant bit is a 1 and the second most significant bit is a 0, we can make use of the following two masks.

One line of thought is based on reversing the array (or parts of it) to obtain the desired result. Think about how reversal might potentially help us out by using an example. The other line of thought is a tad bit complicated but essentially it builds on the idea of placing each element in its original position while keeping track of the element originally in that position. Basically, at every step, we place an element in its rightful position and keep track of the element already there or the one being overwritten in an additional variable.

The runtime complexity of isPrime function would be O(n) and hence counting the total prime numbers up to n would be O(n2). Could we do better? As we know the number must not be divisible by any number > n / 2, we can immediately cut the total iterations half by dividing only up to n / 2. Could we still do better? Let's write down all of 12's factors:

2 × 6 = 12
3 × 4 = 12
4 × 3 = 12
6 × 2 = 12

As you can see, calculations of 4 × 3 and 6 × 2 are not necessary. Therefore, we only need to consider factors up to √n because, if n is divisible by some number p, then n = p × q and since p ≤ q, we could derive that p ≤ √n.
Our total runtime has now improved to O(n1.5), which is slightly better. Is there a faster approach?

} The Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all prime numbers up to n. But don't let that name scare you, I promise that the concept is surprisingly simple.


Sieve of Eratosthenes: algorithm steps for primes below 121. ""Sieve of Eratosthenes Animation"" by SKopp is licensed under CC BY 2.0.

We start off with a table of n numbers. Let's look at the first number, 2. We know all multiples of 2 must not be primes, so we mark them off as non-primes. Then we look at the next number, 3. Similarly, all multiples of 3 such as 3 × 2 = 6, 3 × 3 = 9, ... must not be primes, so we mark them off as well. Now we look at the next number, 4, which was already marked off. What does this tell you? Should you mark off all multiples of 4 as well? 4 is not a prime because it is divisible by 2, which means all multiples of 4 must also be divisible by 2 and were already marked off. So we can skip 4 immediately and go to the next number, 5. Now, all multiples of 5 such as 5 × 2 = 10, 5 × 3 = 15, 5 × 4 = 20, 5 × 5 = 25, ... can be marked off. There is a slight optimization here, we do not need to start from 5 × 2 = 10. Where should we start marking off? In fact, we can mark off multiples of 5 starting at 5 × 5 = 25, because 5 × 2 = 10 was already marked off by multiple of 2, similarly 5 × 3 = 15 was already marked off by multiple of 3. Therefore, if the current number is p, we can always mark off multiples of p starting at p2, then in increments of p: p2 + p, p2 + 2p, ... Now what should be the terminating loop condition? It is easy to say that the terminating loop condition is p < n, which is certainly correct but not efficient. Do you still remember Hint #3? Yes, the terminating loop condition can be p < √n, as all non-primes ≥ √n must have already been marked off. When the loop terminates, all the numbers in the table that are non-marked are prime.
The Sieve of Eratosthenes uses an extra O(n) memory and its runtime complexity is O(n log log n). For the more mathematically inclined readers, you can read more about its algorithm complexity on Wikipedia.
